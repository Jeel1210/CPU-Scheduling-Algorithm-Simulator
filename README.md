🖥️ CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

A web-based simulator that visualizes and compares popular CPU scheduling algorithms used in Operating Systems.
Users can input processes with arrival and burst times, run simulations, and observe scheduling behavior through tables and an animated Gantt chart.

✨ Features

Add and remove processes dynamically

Supports multiple CPU scheduling algorithms:

First Come First Serve (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (Non-preemptive)

Shortest Remaining Time Next (Preemptive)

Round Robin

Displays:

Start time & finish time

Turnaround time

Waiting time

Average turnaround & waiting time

Interactive Gantt chart with:

Play/Pause control

Adjustable animation speed

Clean, dark-themed UI for better readability

📥 Input Parameters

For each process:

Process ID (e.g., P1, P2)

Arrival Time

Burst Time

For Round Robin:

Time Quantum (if applicable)

📊 Output

Detailed scheduling table for each algorithm

Calculated performance metrics:

Turnaround Time

Waiting Time

Averages
